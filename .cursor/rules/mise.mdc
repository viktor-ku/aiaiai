# Using mise-managed tools

This project uses mise to manage tool versions. The `uv` package manager is installed via mise.

To run uv commands, use:

```bash
mise exec -- uv <command>
```

Examples:
- `mise exec -- uv sync` - sync dependencies
- `mise exec -- uv add <package>` - add a new dependency
- `mise exec -- uv run <script>` - run a Python script
